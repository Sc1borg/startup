## GitHub

I learned how to use Github for the first time. It started with learning how to push, pull, and clone different repositories.
## AWS

set up an ec2 instance in class
learned about ip addresses - like mail addresses
tried to set up a domain name, but I had trouble because route 53 wasn't working for me. I eventually turned to a different company, and I might transfer later.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

## HTML

I struggled at first because I didn't understand how to edit my html files and then deploy them, but once I found out that I didn't need to be in my ssh to edit it, it got a lot easier. I got a lot of inspiration from W3 schools and formatting from Genshindle.com

## CSS

This took a couple hours to get it how I wanted. It was important to make it responsive, and I haven't done great yet. CSS is really cool, and it's fun to play with. I hate the way that if you don't have it exactly right it just doesn't do anything. Like no error message just nah.

Bootstrap seems a bit like magic. It styles things nicely, but is very opinionated. You either do, or you do not. There doesn't seem to be much in between.

I love CSS it's so pretty! And it's honestly not too hard to learn!


## React Part 1: Routing

Setting up Vite and React was pretty simple. If there was a ton of CSS it would be a real problem. It sure was nice to have the code structured in a more usable way. Thanks Brynlee for the recommendation

## React Part 2: Reactivity
