# Haikyuudle

[My Notes](notes.md)

I plan to create a wordle-esque game based on an anime that I enjoy. I will create a couple different game modes for things such as quotes, names, and characters. I will store scores, enable login, and allow players to see how they compare to others. I will add additional game modes that relate to a spinoff game that they created.

>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Do you like playing word games and you love Haikyuu? With this application, you will be able to prove your love of both. Play through several different game modes to show your knowledge of the anime and your mental prowess. Login to be able to see how you compare to others and store your top scores.
### Design

I'm not 100% sure how the sequence diagram should look, so I'll update it as I implement different features, but here's the basic parts that I understand.

```mermaid

### Key features

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **Service** - Backend service to enable login and score sharing. Grabs information from the Haikyuu wiki.
- **DB/Login** - Store users and their scores. Securely store login information. Store information relevant to the games.
- **WebSocket** - Broadcast average scores and percentiles.
